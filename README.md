# Database Setup
This app can be run fairly easily if you have SQL Server Lite installed (most likely if you open the solution in Visual Studio). 
Simply figure out your connection string and then update applicationSettings.json with the correct value. The DB_Setup.sql script will
set up the test data when you debug.
